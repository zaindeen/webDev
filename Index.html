                Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White, a chemistry teacher
                who lives in New Mexico with his wife and teenage son who has
                cerebral palsy. White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and
                given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new
                sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and
                a desire to secure his family's financial security,
                White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime
